# Input Glyphs
Displays glyphs (icons) of keyboard & mouse or controller buttons recognized by Unity's InputSystem.

Easy to use and extensible. Glyph images are taken from [Xelu's FREE Controller Prompts](https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/) (CC0). This package can also load Glyphs for Gamepads provided by Steamworks.
