# Input Glyphs
InputGlyphs is a package designed to display button glyph images (icons) of input devices detected by Unity's InputSystem. It is easy to install and designed to allow for the extension of devices and glyph images.

The glyph images in the game will automatically switch according to the device in use.

The package includes pre-configured glyph images for keyboards & mice and various controllers, but you can add or change your own glyph images or use the glyphs provided by Steamworks.
